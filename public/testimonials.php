                <p>There are two things I look for when working with a partner on a project: ethics and drive.
                    I lucked out when I found Karol - who is overflowing with both.
                    Constantly learning and improving, her drive is second to none.  
                    Couple that with her honesty and integrity, there’s no one I’d rather choose to work with.
                    If you have a chance to work with her, don’t hesitate - your investment will be returned many times over.</p>

                <p> I've worked with Karol in a professional capacity (2 jobs) and as a
                    team mate on group projects in school. She's a very hard worker and
                    has a great sense of design. When it came to development, she wasn't
                    satisfied with "good enough" and would go that extra step for better
                    code and cooler functionality.</p>
